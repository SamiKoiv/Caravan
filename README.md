This is a little resource management and free-flowing learning project of mine.

Some features developed so far:
- Item base architecture is in place. The items are based on Unity's ScriptableObjects, which I can later quite easily serialize for save data.
- I created a custom item database editor to help me keep myself sane with the increasing amount of in-game items and resources.
- I have created first iteration for resource upgrading flow where you consume items to produce new items (like iron ore and coal to iron bars).
